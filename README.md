Sprint Review and Retrospective document

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?

  Creating User Stories helps interpret user needs by giving us real-world examples of the user needs and viewing from their perspective. Reading some or hearing someone else's perspective helps us learn and see things from another's view. We often see things and build software to view them and not from a user's standpoint. A user needs to come in and use the software without knowing anything about how it was built. I feel like this is the most significant benefit of the "user stories" from a developer standpoint.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  After taking this class, it has really helped me with how I will approach future class and software development. I think this class has been a tremendous help, even though it has little programming involved. Being taught and showed how to take small chunks of a project and to work a little at a time. I hope to incorporate the sprint method and backlog the most in my future projects and even classes. I am really excited about how much this class has seemed to help with time management.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  I feel that being a good team member in software development means being open and transparent with your strengths and weaknesses—not being afraid to ask questions and or helping others when you are able. Being a team player and taking accountability, and not casting blame on others. Another thought that is not brought up much is being able to continue to learn new ways and methods. When someone is stuck in their ways and is unwilling to adapt to the changing markets or workflows or whatever it may be, it can make for a challenging team member.
